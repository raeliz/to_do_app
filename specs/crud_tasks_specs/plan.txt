this is where i will place my test plan for the crud task process

I will login and select "New Task" and create a new task

I will input a title and description and create a new task

I will then choose to Edit task and update the title and description

I will then mark the task as done and verify the task is marked correctly

I will then delete selected task and verify that it no longer exists on the page
