Auth Test Plan: 
OBJECTIVE: verify that auth works as expected

(before each, navigate to To-Do website)

- Signup
    Scenario: User sign up
        When I navigate to 'TO-DO' website, I will click the "New User? Sign up" link
        Then I fill in respected fields with my information (${signupUser} and ${password}) AND click "Sign Up" link
        Then I should be redirected to the Login screen
        
    Scenario: User cannot sign up twice
        When I click the "New User? Sign up" link
        And I fill in respected fields with my same information (${signupUser} and ${password}) AND click "Sign Up" link
        Then I should see the error message "Username already exists" and will be unable to continue to login page
    
    
- Login
    Scenario: User login with valid credentials
        When I login using my valid credentials (${username} and ${password})
        Then I should see the "TO-DO" homepage
        
    Scenario: User login with invalid credentials
        When I login using invalid credentials (`notValid${username}` and `notValid${password}`) OR when I login using my valid username but invalid password
        Then I should see the error message "Please check your login details and try again"


- Logout
    Scenario: User log out
        When I login using my valid credentials (${username} and ${password})
        And I should see the 'Logout' link on the page
        And I click the 'Logout' link
